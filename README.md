# **GitHub Contribution Snake to Video Generator**

A simple Node.js script that captures the animated GitHub contribution grid snake SVG and converts it into a panoramic MP4 video, perfect for sharing on social media platforms like Instagram.

This project uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) for browser automation and frame capture, and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for video encoding.

## **Features**

* Converts the animated snake SVG into a high-quality MP4 video.  
* Customizable resolution for panoramic and ultra-widescreen output.  
* Advanced animation control to fix speed and looping issues by modifying the SVG's speed during capture.  
* Supports GPU-accelerated encoding (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel QSV) for significantly faster performance.

## **Prerequisites**

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)  
* Up-to-date graphics card drivers (for GPU acceleration).

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone \[https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git\](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**  
   cd your-repo-name

3. **Install the necessary dependencies:**  
   npm install

## **Usage**

1. Configure the settings at the top of the create-video.js file to match your needs (see Configuration section below).  
2. Run the script from your terminal:  
   node create-video.js

3. The process will start, capturing frames and then encoding the video. This may take a few minutes depending on your hardware and configuration.  
4. The final video will be saved as output.mp4 in the project's root directory.

## **Configuration**

You can easily customize the output by editing the variables at the top of the create-video.js script.

* VIDEO\_CODEC: Choose the video encoder.  
  * libx264: CPU-based encoding (slowest but most compatible).  
  * h264\_nvenc: For NVIDIA GPUs.  
  * h264\_amf: For AMD GPUs.  
  * h264\_qsv: For Intel integrated graphics.  
* SVG\_URL: The URL of the snake animation SVG file. By default, it uses the one generated by the popular GitHub action.  
* VIDEO\_DURATION\_SECONDS: The desired final length of the video in seconds. This should match the original animation's duration.  
* SLOWDOWN\_FACTOR: A multiplier to slow down the animation during capture. **Increase this value if the snake still moves too fast or loops in the final video.**  
* OUTPUT\_WIDTH & OUTPUT\_HEIGHT: The resolution of the final video. The height must be an even number.
